## Project Overview

This project explores the application of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) techniques to high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies. The theoretical foundation is backed by a detailed LaTeX report covering quantum noise, fidelity decay, and the feasibility of using quantum circuits in trading environments.

Key aspects:
- Benchmarking on IBMQ backends
- Fidelity analysis under depolarizing noise
- Modular and reproducible structure
- Academic and research-ready format
